abstract = {Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are receiving more attention than ever before. Yet the motivations for issuance vary across countries, as do the policy approaches and technical designs. We investigate the economic and institutional drivers of CBDC development and take stock of design efforts. We set out a comprehensive database of technical approaches and policy stances on issuance, relying on central bank speeches and technical reports. Most projects are found in digitised economies with a high capacity for innovation. Work on retail CBDCs is more advanced where the informal economy is larger. We next take stock of the technical design options. More and more central banks are considering retail CBDC architectures in which the CBDC is a direct cash-like claim on the central bank, but where the private sector handles all customer-facing activity. We conclude with an in-depth description of three distinct CBDC approaches by the central banks of China, Sweden and Canada.},

This article historically and geographically reviews central bank digital currency studies throughout the world. The historical review shows that initially, some central banks focused on retail CBDC (targeting the general public), while other central banks focused on wholesale CBDC. Facebook's announcement about its Libra project shifted the focus to retail CBDC. However, more recently, there has been renewed interest in studying wholesale CBDC. The geographical review shows that 90 \% of central banks are currently studying CBDC. A (necessarily selective) survey of these studies reveals the diversity of the motivations, contexts, and approaches behind them, but also a consensus on a number of founding principles.

I test this hypothesis by exploiting cross-country shadow market variation and exogenous shocks to darknet marketplaces used exclusively for illegal transactions in 28 emerging market economies. I find that Bitcoin trade volume generated by underground activity reacts much more strongly to inflation expectations than Bitcoin trade volume among the general population, providing direct evidence that shadow market participants substitute away from cash and towards cryptocurrency to conduct anonymous transactions. This effect is particularly strong among countries experiencing high annual inflation.},

These developments have raised the possibility of considerable impacts on the financial system and perhaps the wider economy. This paper addresses the question of whether a central bank should issue digital currency that could be used by the general public. It begins by discussing the possible motivations for a central bank to issue a digital currency. The paper then sets out a benchmark central bank digital currency (CBDC) with features that are similar to cash. The implications of such a digital currency are explored, focusing on central bank seigniorage, monetary policy, the banking system and financial stability, and payments. Finally, a CBDC that differs from the benchmark digital currency in a significant way is considered.},

From beads and feathers to metal and paper money they have always improved the way transactions were made. The invention of the Internet opened new doors in the field of payments, through the quick access to information and the emergence of significant international online communities. The members of these communities became aware of the importance of decentralising the way they acquire goods or services, thus eliminating the middlemen. Cryptocurrencies represent the response of these communities to the old centralised means of payment, controlled by the bankers, politicians and interest groups. Our paper aims to analyse the cryptocurrency phenomenon revealing some of its advantages and disadvantages, to increase the awareness on the topic. We based our research on the existing literature, the relevant international databases, the official positions of the financial and regulatory institutions on the analysed matter.},

The database focuses on measures that have strong cross-country and over time coverage: it includes both model-based and survey-based measures of informality and covers more than 160 economies for the period 1990-2018. The paper illustrates two applications of the database. First, it distills stylized facts of informal activity, including its declining trend and pervasiveness in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Second, it documents the cyclical features of the informal economy. Overall, informal economy recessions (recoveries) do not differ significantly from those of formal economy. Like formal-economy business cycles, informal-economy business cycles tend to be shallower in advanced economies than in EMDEs. Informal employment in both advanced economies and EMDEs appears to be largely acyclical.},

In this setting, selection of tax institutions becomes part of the apparatus by which Leviathan is constrained. Such an approach generates tax rules strikingly at variance with more conventional norms. In particular, the goal of a ‘comprehensive’ tax base, which informs standard analysis, gives way to a preference for specific limitations on the width of the tax base: moves towards a greater comprehensiveness will lead inexorably to larger public spending, and beyond some point are clearly undesirable. The analysis also implies a rather unconventional defense of progression in the tax structure. An attempt is made to relate the discussion to contemporary tax reform issues.},

  abstract={ As of 2009, the concept of decentrally-issued digital assets which, according to their promoters, could replace legal tender, was put forward to the public. More than a decade on, this project has still not been implemented. Stablecoins, which have emerged more recently, are designed to be more like legal tender and aim to remedy the shortcomings in the first generation of crypto-assets. However, they still carry many risks. In response to these initiatives, both central banks and private operators have launched innovative projects in the field of payment infrastructure and instruments. The Banque de France in turn has begun experiments on a digital euro. À partir de 2009, des actifs digitaux émis de manière décentralisée, susceptibles selon leurs promoteurs de se substituer aux monnaies légales, ont été proposés au public. Plus de dix ans après, ce projet ne s’est pas réalisé. D’émergence plus récente, les stablecoins tentent de se rapprocher des monnaies légales et visent à remédier aux insuffisances des premiers crypto actifs, mais ils sont également porteurs de nombreux risques. Face à ces initiatives, tant les banques centrales que les acteurs privés se mobilisent sur des projets innovants dans le domaine des infrastructures et des moyens de paiement. C’est ainsi que la Banque de France a engagé des expérimentations sur un euro digital.},

  abstract={ The unconventional monetary policies implemented by central banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and subsequently in that of the Covid-19 health crisis, have led to a faster increase in money than in prices, prompting a review of the link between the two. This article recalls in the first two parts the concepts linking money and inflation, i.e. the money multiplier and the velocity of circulation of money, using the cases of the euro area and the United States as examples. Part three shows that while the link between money and inflation is preserved in the long run, consistent with the quantitative theory of money, it has become significantly distorted in the recent period. One reason for this disconnect in the shorter term is that unconventional monetary policies do not act on inflation via the money multiplier and the quantity of money in circulation, but by lowering long-term interest rates and financing conditions for households and businesses. They have thus made it possible to avoid episodes of deflation, and inflation would have been significantly lower without them. Les politiques monétaires non conventionnelles mises en oeuvre par les banques centrales dans le sillage de la crise financière de 2008, puis de la crise sanitaire de la Covid-19, se sont accompagnées d’une hausse plus rapide de la monnaie que des prix, ce qui invite à réexaminer le lien entre les deux. Cet article rappelle dans les deux premières parties les concepts reliant monnaie et inflation, c’est-à-dire le multiplicateur monétaire et la vitesse de circulation de la monnaie, en les illustrant dans les cas de la zone euro et des États-Unis. Une troisième partie montre que si le lien entre monnaie et inflation est préservé à long terme, en accord avec la théorie quantitative de la monnaie, il s’est fortement distendu dans la période récente. Cette déconnexion à plus court terme vient notamment du fait que les politiques monétaires non conventionnelles n’agissent pas sur l’inflatio},

abstract = {This article analyzes the monetary policy of major central banks during the economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising public debt in many countries is being financed through asset purchases by monetary authorities. Although these stimulus policies predate the pandemic, they have been significantly boosted as many governments face large financing needs. We have been in a low interest rate environment for years and some governments have issued debt securities at negative rates. In addition, the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies, based on blockchain technology, has created greater competition in the international monetary system and many governments have considered the creation of centralized virtual currencies, known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). We will analyze some relevant cases, with an emphasis on the digital euro project. The methodology is based on the analysis of the evolution of monetary variables. Pearson’s correlation will be used to establish some relationships between them. There is a strong similarity in the expansionary monetary policies of central banks. Although the growth of the money supply has not been passed on to the CPI, it has been passed on to the financial markets and the price of assets such as Bitcoin or gold.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on how technology might reshape payments going forward. It considers the policy issues and choices associated with crypto-currencies, stablecoins and sovereign digital currencies and emphasises that there is no single model for sovereign digital currency design. While Bitcoin and its progenies could be safely ignored by regulators, Facebook’s proposal for Libra, a global stablecoin, brought an immediate and potent response from regulators globally. Any proposal by the private sector to move into the creation of currency — the traditional preserve of sovereigns — was always likely to trigger such a regulatory response, as well as the launch of sovereign digital currencies by other major central banks. While China has moved first, dozens of other countries are now investigating their own central bank digital currencies or other forms of sovereign digital currency. This paper argues that central banks should first focus not on rolling out novel new forms of sovereign digital currencies, but rather on transforming their payment systems. In time, domestic money and payment systems are expected to evolve so that central banks cooperate with (new and old) private entities to launch digital currencies that better underpin monetary and payment systems at the domestic, regional and international levels.},
